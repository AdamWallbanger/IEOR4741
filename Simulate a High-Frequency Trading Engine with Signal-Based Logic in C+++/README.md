## Session 2 Simulate a High-Frequency Trading Engine with Signal-Based Logic in C+++
* Signal 3 is being triggered the most
* The current trading engine can be further optimized in several ways. First, the price history is updated using erase(), which is inefficient because it shifts all elements. A fixed-size ring buffer would make updates faster and constant time. Similarly, since the number of instruments is small and fixed, replacing the hash map with a simple array would reduce lookup overhead and improve cache efficiency. Another improvement is to maintain rolling averages instead of recalculating the mean each time, which would lower computational cost.
In addition, efficiency can be improved by reusing a single random number generator instead of constructing one repeatedly, and by reserving capacity for vectors such as orders and latencies to avoid costly reallocations. Finally, the frequent use of high-resolution clock calls adds overhead; reducing unnecessary timing operations would make the latency measurement lighter. Together, these optimizations would allow the system to handle larger data volumes with lower latency.
* With 100000 feeds of data, the entire process run for 168449ms, and with 1000000 feeds of data, it took 1595689ms which is approximately 10 times of the time.
